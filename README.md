## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I learned about the fieldset and legend tags to create sections inside a form tag, especially to a group checkbox or radio buttons.

Also, I learned how to apply styles to forms' elements(Change font size, colour, etc.) using the next block of style:

```css
button, input, select, textarea {
    font-family: inherit;
    font-size: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I started to learn about magic numbers, both, in CSS and programming(JS in my case). I wan to know more about this topic. Also, I want to improve about my knowlege and uses of the advanced selectors in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Web Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) - I used this to understand about the fieldset and legend tags.
- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is a great post to understand about Grid. It helped me to get some results I didn't know how to do them because I didn't know the correct properties.
- [Advanced CSS selectors](https://www.davidvalverde.com/blog/selectores-avanzados-css/) - This post explain useful selectors in CSS.
- [Magic number in CSS](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/magic-numbers-in-css-how-to-identify-and-fight-them/#:~:text=At%20least%20in%20CSS%2C%20using,magic%20numbers%20into%20your%20codebase.) - I like this post because know I understand why is better to use the line-height property with an unitless value.
